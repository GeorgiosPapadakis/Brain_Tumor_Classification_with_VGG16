# Brain_Tumor_Classification_with_VGG16
In this repository we have two files:


1) Notebook: On this notebook is my attempt to create a transfer learning project for image classifiction

  The model that I create has these parts:
   - VGG16: Pretrained model that is used for features extraction
   - Attention layer: Attention that enhances the features
   - FCNN: A classic Neural Network as the head of the model, that makes the classification

  I use Tensorflow for the building and training of the model.

  The notebook was created at Kaggle, so the dataset was imported for there.

2) Model: The output model, after the training.
